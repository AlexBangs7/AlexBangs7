- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlexBangs7
- 👀 I’m interested in population genomics, pharmacology, and ecology (in my spare time)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build spatial pop gen simulations on SLiM
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever right now
- 📫 How to reach me: you'd like to know that, wouldn't you?
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers
- ⚡ Fun fact: Dinosaurs likely didn't roar like they do in Jurassic Park, but instead some may have produced bellows like alligators do!
